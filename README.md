# Mini-bootcamp

The mini-bootcamps are a way to finish the bootcamp prerequisites or concentrate for an important amount of time on a topic that you want to learn.

We are exploring different mini-bootcamps, that might evolve in the near future.


## Work on the bootcamp prerequisites

You can attend this mini-bootcamp to work on the prerequisites at your own pace, as we do at [Coding for everyone](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/) events, but for an extended period of time.

You can prepare faster for a bootcamp or just continue the Coding for everyone experience for a longer period of time.

**Length**: 1 week, full time, 10-18 every day

**Topics**: [Bootcamp prerequisites](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/prerequisites.md)

**Next starting dates**: 2 October 2017, January/February 2018

## Set up your developer machine

You've been fiddling with code for a while, maybe in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), but it's now time to move forward and do some coding on your computer.

To be an effective developer we recommend you to use Linux or macOS. Either way you need to learn about using the terminal, installing packages, logging into a remote server

In this mini-bootcamp we'll set up your machine, install together the toolbox of the developer, set up a server machine over SSH and publish a minimal website.
